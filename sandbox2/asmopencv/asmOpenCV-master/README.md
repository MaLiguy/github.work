Simple methods to convert between [OpenCV](http://opencv.org)'s cv::Mat and [Qt](https://www.qt.io/developers)'s [QImage](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qimage.html) and [QPixmap](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qpixmap.html).

The simple example shows how to use the methods to apply Gaussian blur to an image.  Note that you will need to change `OPENCV_INSTALL` in **example/example.pro** to point at your OpenCV files.
